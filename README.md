### üß± A library to work with instagram `bloks` technology
Instagram recently created a technology to make their new app [`Instagram Lite`](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.lite) very light. Instead of using an API that gives back the data to the app, then parsing it, then displaying it, they are now returning the data, and the displaying method. The concept is the same as a simple HTML page. [Here's an article talking about it](https://thenewstack.io/instagram-lite-is-no-longer-a-progressive-web-app-now-a-native-app-built-with-bloks/). This library is the `bs4` for `bloks`.
### ‚ö†Ô∏è This library is currently being develloped, it might be unstable.
